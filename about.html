  <h1>About This Website</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my notes website!
This platform is created to help first-year engineering students access all important notes, lab manuals, assignments, and study materials in one place.

My goal is to provide clear, easy-to-understand notes so that students can save time and study more effectively. All the notes are well-organized subject-wise and updated regularly.

Whether you are preparing for exams or revising any topic, you will find everything you need here. I hope these notes make your learning experience simple and stress-free.
